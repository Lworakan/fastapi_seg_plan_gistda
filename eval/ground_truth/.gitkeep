# Ground Truth Masks (Optional)

Place ground truth segmentation masks here with the **same filenames** as test images.

## Format:
- Binary masks: 0 (background), 255 (road)
- Grayscale PNG images
- Same dimensions as test images (or will be auto-resized)

## Example:
If you have `test_images/imagepan.png`, place the ground truth as `ground_truth/imagepan.png`
